The boy scouts have done so much for me and helped me become the man I am today. The process of becoming an Eagle Scout starts the day you join the Scouts at 11 years old, and it culminates in your Eagle Scout project. My project was reinforcing and expanding a local church\'s community garden. Before we got there, it was in a sad state. They had horrible plastic netting around it that wasn\'t stopping any animals from getting in. Over the course of 2 months and the help of many scouts and local community members, we were able to build a brand-new fence that was made up of over 30 4x4s sunk over a foot and a half into the ground with wire fencing attached to the posts. We were also able to expand the garden and include two more 6x12 beds so more people could participate and try their hand at gardening.   ')"/>
