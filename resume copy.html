They had horrible plastic netting around it that wasn\'t stopping any animals from getting in. Over the course of 2 months and the help of many scouts and local community members, we were able to build a brand new fence that was made up of over 30 4x4s sunk over a foot and a half into the ground with wire fencing attached to the posts. We were also able to expand the garden and include two more 6x12 beds so more people could particpate and try their hand at gardening. ')"    />
